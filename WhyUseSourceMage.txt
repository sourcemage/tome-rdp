Why should I use Source Mage?

 * Does sourcemage handle dependencies?
Yes. All packages denote their dependencies and our package management system
will automatically compile and install them in the appropriate order.

 * Does sourcemage suffer from dependency hell?
No. Source Mage's package management system automatically traverses the
dependency graph and installs dependent packages in the appropriate order. Since
everything is compiled from source, the packages are, in general, less picky
about specific versions. However, this being said, we reccomend that you keep
your system up to date. Tracking the stable grimoire should be sufficient.
<<Still needs more work>>

 * Does Source Mage handle multiple versions?
Yes. We maintain several versions of the gcc compiler, because certain spells do
not compile under, say gcc 4.0.x. We've got  gcc 3.3 and gcc 3.4 packages for
when specific packages need that version of gcc. For the majority of cases, if
two versions of a certain program are needed, multiple packages are created.
Most often, only one version of a specific package is installed anyway

 * Can I hand edit a version quickly and easily?
Yes. Packages are all plain text and written in bash. It doesn't take very much
skill to modify any specific part of the package. <<LINK TO SOME THING MORE
SPECIFIC>>

 * Does sourcemage have the latest version of $FOO?
The grimoires are updated fairly often. Version updates are made on a best
effort basis. See <<<OUR PACKAGE LISTING PAGE>> If you don't see a version of a
specific spell in there, please feel free to submit a patch or two. [[see How to
contribute]]

 * Can Source Mage handle binary/pre-compiled packages?
You bet! The compilation step is then basically a no-op.

 * Can I use non Free (proprietary) software on Source Mage?
Yes, we have packages for things such as Nvidia's drivers and Sun's java.
<<<Z-rejected>> Note that Source Mage will never depend on any of these packages
nor will any non-free software be included in the main grimoire. See our
[[Social Contract]].

 * Can Source Mage detect and repair broken packages?
Yes. There's a tool called cleanse that can detect and repair most broken
packages.

 * How long does it take to install?
Depends on a few factors mostly how fast your computer is. You should be able to
get your system installed in about a half hour to an hour and a half. The
rebuilding process after installing typically is an overnight task.

 * Can I build my own install CD?
Not yet. Probably the best way to do that is to use a basic boot cd of your own
and tarball up a chroot you've built. Or see the [[How to contribute]]

 * Does it have a LiveCD to try?
Not yet. However, Source Mage is quite well behaved in a chroot. See [[How to
contribute]]

 * How do I get support?
The best way to get support is to show up in #sourcemage on irc.freenode.net.
Most of our developers idle on irc and are quite happy to help. You are also
welcome to hang out there :) If you can stand the latency, the
sm-discuss@lists.ibiblio.org mailing list is another good place. We do have
forums but they're not as actively perused as the mailing lists and irc. We're a
friendly bunch, except for that one guy, so drop on buy and chat :)

 * I notice the current version is below 1.0, is SourceMage a young
distribution?
Source Mage has been around since 2002, at least. See [[Sourcemage history]].
We're not 1.0 yet, because we don't feel that everything is sufficiently feature
complete. We have set our bar very high, and we'll not call it 1.0 until we are
comfortable that it is deserving of the 1.0 title. Most of the developers use it
on all the systems they own. None of us have any qualms about using it in a
production environment.

 * What platforms does SMGL support?
Source Mage has a ppc, x86 and x86_64 install cd. Most popular architectures are
x86 and x86_64. There are some people that have Source Mage installed on sparcs.
If you're willing to do a bit of work, you can get Source Mage installed on any
architecture. See [[how to contribute]] once you've done it, don't forget to
take notes ;)

 * Can I run SMGL on a production system?
Yes. The author has several systems running Source Mage n production.
www.sourcemage.org is a Source Mage system. As is our source code repository ([[OMG LINK TO GIT HERE]]git, btw.

 * I've got $FOO hardware, will it work in Source Mage?
If the linux kernel supports it, yes. If ndiswrapper will do it, yes. Basically,
anything any other distro can do, we can probably do.

 * Is Source Mage a totally free distribution?
Yes. All our documentation is released under the GNU Documentation License and
all our programs (being the programs we write for Source Mage) are released
under the GPL. This includes our spells. However, the program the spells install
may not be GPL. The z-rejected grimoire contains spells that, for whatever
reason, aren't GPL or are released binary only. Our [[ Social Contract ]] has more specifics.

 * Do you have package $FOO?
Probably, see [[listing]]. If you don't see what you want, and the package has a fairly standard build setup (instructions help :) ) then making a package yourself is quite trivial. We've even got an automated tool to help called [[Quill]]. Feel free to submit the package to us, see [[How To Contribute]].

 * Package $FOO isn't in any grimoires, what do I do?
See [[How to contribute]]. This distribution is maintained by the people that
use it. You can put in a request to have a spell added, but we're all busy and
it may get ignored. If you want to see somethign in there that's not, it is
reccomended to build your spell and submit it. It has a very good chance of
getting added.
