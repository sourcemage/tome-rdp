Why should I use Source Mage?

 * How does sourcemage handle dependencies?
Spells are written to include the dependent packages. As long as any dependent
packages are installed, the spell will compile and install. In a few cases,
where a specific option or version is needed to ensure that the spell builds,
sub_depends are used to ensure that the spells in question have the necessary
options enabled, or disabled, or the necessary version is built.

 * Does sourcemage suffer from dependency hell?
Not in the sense that building the new version of, say, xorg would require you
to update all of the libraries on your system. You can attempt to build xorg
against the older libraries you've currently got installed on your computer. If
it fails, you might consider updating some of the depenedencies. Source mage
doesn't requre a specific version of libs unless specifically noted for the
spells to build.

 * Does Source Mage handle multiple versions?
Yes. Probably not in the way you're thinking, however. If spells are binarily
incompatible, then there will be different versions in the grimoire, and they
will be named accordingly. For example, libstdc++, libstdc++2, libstdc++3. The
ABI for those spells are each different, and can all be installed in parallel.
For other spells, like gnupg, or cvs, you will be asked for which version to
install.

 * Can I hand edit a version quickly and easily?
Yes! Spells are all written in bash, and the configuration files are in plain
text. It's quite trivial to edit the DETAILS file and update a version number.
Sorcery will then download the specified version that you've just entered. All
the spell files are in plain text so it will be very easy to apply a quick hack
to any of them.

 * Does sourcemage have the latest version of $FOO?
The grimoires are updated daily, at least. Version updates are made on a best
effort basis. If you don't see a version of a specific spell in there, please
feel free to submit a patch or two. [[see How to contribute]]

 * Can Source Mage handle binary only packages?
You bet! Nvidia's binary drivers are supported as well as Sun's Java. You have
to answer yes to install these spells every time you install them, as they've
got specific licenses that you may have to agree to that sorcery cannot for
you.

 * Can Source Mage detect and repair broken packages?
Yes. There's a tool called cleanse which goes through the installed packages and
ensures that all the files that were installed by them still exist, as well as
verifies that the linked libraries all exist. It also checks the md5 sums of all
the installed files to verify that they've not been modified. Configuration
files and files that are mutable are ignored.

 * How long does it take to install?
Depends on a few factors: how fast is your computer, how many packages you
installed, if you're building a kernel from source instead of just copying the
default kernel over. I'd say you could get a basic install done, copying kernel,
in under a half hour.

 * Can I build my own install CD?
Not yet. Probably the best way to do that is to use a basic boot cd of your own
and tarball up a chroot you've built. Or see the [[How to contribute]]

 * Does it have a LiveCD to try?
Not yet. See [[How to contribute]]

 * How do I get support?
The best way to get support is to show up in #sourcemage on irc.freenode.net.
It's the most developer active location. If you can stand the latency, the
sm-discuss@lists.ibiblio.org mailing list is another good place. We do have
forums but they're not as actively perused as the mailing lists and irc. We're a
friendly bunch, except for that one guy, so drop on buy and chat :)

 * I notice the current version is below 1.0, is SourceMage a young
distribution?
Source Mage has been around since 2002, at least. See [[Sourcemage history]].
We're not 1.0 yet, because we don't feel that everything is sufficiently feature
complete or stable enough. The distro is running our main webserver without
problems. The author has no qualms using it on production systems. 

 * What platforms does SMGL support?
Source Mage has a ppc, x86 and x86_64 install cd. Most popular architectures are
x86 and x86_64. There are some people that have Source Mage installed on sparcs.
If you're willing to do a bit of work, you can get Source Mage installed on any
architecture. See [[how to contribute]] once you've done it, don't forget to
take notes ;)

 * Can I run SMGL on a production system?
Yes. The author has several systems running Source Mage n production.
www.sourcemage.org is a Source Mage system. As is our git repository.

 * I've got $FOO hardware, will it work in Source Mage?
If the linux kernel supports it, yes. If ndiswrapper will do it, yes. Basically,
anything any other distro can do, we can probably do.

 * Is Source Mage a totally free distribution?
Yes. All our documentation is released under the GNU Documentation License and
all our programs (being the programs we write for Source Mage) are released
under the GPL. This includes our spells. However, the program the spells install
may not be GPL. The z-rejected grimoire contains spells that, for whatever
reason, aren't GPL or are binary only.

 * I think found a bug, what do I do?
See [[bug reporting procedures]]

 * Package $FOO isn't in any grimoires, what do I do?
See [[How to contribute]]. This distribution is maintained by the people that
use it. You can put in a request to have a spell added, but we're all busy and
it may get ignored. If you want to see somethign in there that's not, it is
reccomended to build your spell and submit it. It has a very good chance of
getting added.
